“Design a warm, supportive, and professional website for VidyaGrid – AI-based Drop-out Prediction and Counseling System. The overall feel should be comforting and student-friendly using earth-tone colors like soft greens, warm browns, beige, and cream. The website must be modern, clean, and intuitive while conveying empathy, trust, and encouragement.

✅ Home Page

Logo: VidyaGrid

Tagline examples:
‘Empowering Students, Enabling Success’ or
‘Together We Learn, Together We Grow.’

Short description:
“VidyaGrid helps schools and students stay connected, track academic progress, and access personalized counseling through AI-driven insights — for brighter futures and stronger communities.”

Two clear buttons:
➤ Admin Login
➤ Student Login

Illustrations in earth tones showing collaboration, growth charts, and care networks.

Footer with contact information, privacy policy, and social media links.

✅ Login Page

Simple, calming interface with soft backgrounds and gentle transitions.

Fields for username/email and password.

Links for ‘Forgot Password’ and ‘Create Account’.

Warm, minimal design to reduce stress and encourage use.

✅ Admin Dashboard

Dropout risk overview with charts and graphs.

List of at-risk students with counseling suggestions.

Notifications and alerts for timely interventions.

Data insights explained in clear visual formats.

Accessible reports export and role-based privacy controls.

✅ Student Dashboard

Personalized progress report with attendance, grades, and risk score.

Counseling suggestions and helpful resources.

A Chatbot button clearly visible on the screen that, when clicked, opens a fully functional chatbot window.

The chatbot should provide empathetic guidance, answer student questions, help with academic concerns, and assist with emotional support.

It should be interactive, responsive, and easy to use without needing to leave the dashboard.

Friendly and supportive interface that encourages students to seek help when needed.

✅ Design Style

Earth-tone colors: soft green, brown, beige, cream.

Rounded edges, soft shadows, and smooth transitions for a calming feel.

Plenty of whitespace for readability and comfort.

Clean typography that is approachable and professional.

A warm, welcoming experience that builds trust and motivation.

✅ Special Notes

The chatbot feature must be fully integrated within the student dashboard, not as a separate page but as a pop-up or overlay that stays accessible.

The chatbot should feel like a real-time assistant and should not disrupt the user’s workflow.

The platform must emphasize security, privacy, and ease of use across all interfaces.

The website should reflect VidyaGrid’s mission: supporting students, empowering schools, and ensuring no student is left behind — all through compassionate technology.”
